# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - Hashes were much easier to grasp than methods for some reason. Remembering to add all the necessary commas were probably the biggest issue I had. Using strings for the keys also took me sometime to get used to seeing. Find myself definitely prefering symbols.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - I like taking notes on everything so that has come pretty easy. The process of commiting thought to paper is a cornerstone of my learning process. Writing code out in my notebook and labeling all of its components has be especially helpful and I have referenced it pretty frequently. 
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I have been throwing things into the terminal just to see if I can parce out any issues I am encountering first. I am not sure if my questions are so basic as to not return many google results or if I need to be better at phrasing them when I go that route.
